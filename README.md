A program made in Java that allows you to check football scores. Uses the binary, sockets, HTTP and RMI protocol and the principles of 
distributed systems. 
Consists on a server that waits for clients to connect, and then the clients can watch the match score and update it and all the other
clients will see the updated result made by the other clients. This is all made in a web browser and on the command line, in that 
version the client can add
a comment to the on going match and can see all the comments made by other clients, all that on the browser. That program was made to a university subject called
Distributed Systems.
